# AutomaticWateringSystem

An automatic watering system created using both hardware and software. The hardware used was a Raspberry Pi Zero W, Teensy LC, 12 Volt Water pump, two moisture sensors, and a power supply. 

This also comes with a companion android app to control the system, which can be seen in my WaterSystemApp respository.
